========================
Bounded Sets of Integers
========================

This should go into $GOROOT/src/pkg/container/intset or
some such place eventually; I test it there anyway. :-D

Peter Williams is working on something similar, check out
http://github.com/pwil3058/gosets for his take. I looked
at his code for a while before deciding to do my own: In
the end I simply couldn't decide which way is better, so
instead of debating around to get him to change his code
I decided to let another flower bloom and have others in
the Go universe make a decision for us. :-D

I have three implementations here so far:

  Bitset is a bitvector
  Sparse is Briggs and Torczon's representation
  Hash is a map[int]bool

Right now, Sparse seems to win in terms of ops/sec but
of course that representation eats a LOT of memory...
