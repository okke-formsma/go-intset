========================
Bounded Sets of Integers
========================

Peter Williams is working on something similar, check out
http://github.com/pwil3058/gosets for his take. I looked
at his code for a while before deciding to do my own: In
the end I simply couldn't decide which way is better, so
instead of debating around to get him to change his code
I decided to let another flower bloom and have others in
the Go universe make a decision for us. :-D

Note that I am coming at this from a compiler angle, the
next set implementation I'll add is the sparse set stuff
Gibbs and Torczon came up with. Stay tuned.
